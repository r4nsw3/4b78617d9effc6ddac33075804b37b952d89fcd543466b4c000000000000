  |   In the near future, the official racing federation has ordered a      |
  |   seasons pause from racing, to allow teams to ease into the            |
  |   transition to flying vehicles. To bridge this gap, top hybrid car     |
  |   manufacturers host a rogue championship for rookie drivers on the     |
  |   streets of cities worldwide. Their advanced cars drive on             |
  |   electricity and Xenon gas, resulting in crazy speeds. Get behind      |
  |   the wheel, keep your adrenaline in check and drift through the        |
  |   streets. Boost to absurd speeds and become the ultimate Xenon         |
